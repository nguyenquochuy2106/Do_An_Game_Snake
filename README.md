<h2>How To Play</h2>

The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats more apples, it will grow in length and move faster.

<ul>
  <li>Up: Press the up arrow key to move the snake upwards.</li>
  <li>Down: Press the down arrow key to move the snake downwards.</li>
  <li>Left: Press the left arrow key to move the snake to the left.</li>
